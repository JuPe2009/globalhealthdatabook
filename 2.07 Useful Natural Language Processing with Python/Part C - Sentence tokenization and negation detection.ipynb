    "\n",
    "1. The same medical concept can be described in many different equivalent ways in unstructured texts. A more robust vocabulary that recognize a concept of interest in many forms would help you spot the concept with higher sensitivity.\n",
    "2. After spotting an occurrence of a term of interest in unstructured text, it may be important to interpret its context next.\n",
    "3. Negation detection is one type of NLP context interpretation. There are many others and the importance of each depends on your task.\n",
    "4. Negation detection at its simplest may be the detection of a negation-related term (e.g. no) in the same sentence. More complex NLP libraries, such as Negex and sPacy, can help you do a better job in more complicated cases.\n",
    "5. At a whole document level, a term or concept may be mentioned in multiple sentences in different context. It is up to experts (you) to determine how to put together all the information to give the best prediction for the patient."
