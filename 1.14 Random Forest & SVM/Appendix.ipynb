    "- Domain knowledge: the knowledge to understand input data, for example, clinical knowledge of the correlation between age and ICU survival probablity. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Features: variables which contribute to classify the data points, e.g. clinical varaibles \n",
    "\n",
    "- Labels: the class that the data points belong to, e.g. died or survived in ICU \n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear separation: There exits a straight line or plane, to separate between data points from two classes (e.g. died / survived). \n",
    "\n",
    "- RBF kernel: Radial-basis function kernel. It is used as similarity measure between two points. The formula for RBF is $k(x_i, x_j) = exp(-1 / 2 d(x_i / length_scale, x_j / length_scale)^2)$\n",

    "- Ensemble:  Ensemblling is using multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone."
